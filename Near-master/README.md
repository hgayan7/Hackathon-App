# Near
Near is a P2P library which allows
* Discovery like Android NSD, though with greater reliability and easier-to-use *NearDiscovery* API
* Transfers among clients through an easy-to-use *NearConnect* API

## Sample Usage

Sample app, with the source code [here](app/) is [available on PlayStore](https://goo.gl/kioAiQ).

## NearDiscovery
NearDiscovery takes hostname and a bunch of settings in a builder pattern for the discovery mechanism. A NearDiscovery object allows the following discovery related self-explanatory APIs:
* ```void makeDiscoverable(String hostName);```
* ```void makeNonDiscoverable();```
* ```void startDiscovery();```
* ```void stopDiscovery();```
* ```Set<Host> getAllAvailablePeers();```
* ```boolean isDiscoverable();```
* ```boolean isDiscovering();```

Here's how the NearDiscovery object is created
```
private NearDiscovery mNearDiscovery = new NearDiscovery.Builder()
                .setContext(this)
                .setDiscoverableTimeoutMillis(DISCOVERABLE_TIMEOUT_MILLIS)
                .setDiscoveryTimeoutMillis(DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MILLIS)
                .setDiscoverablePingIntervalMillis(DISCOVERABLE_PING_INTERVAL_MILLIS)
                .setDiscoveryListener(getNearDiscoveryListener(), Looper.getMainLooper())
                .build();
```
The Looper passed as the 2nd param of NearDiscovery.Builder.setDiscoveryListener() is for the thread on which the listener, the 1st param, should be called.
Sample listener:
```
    @NonNull
    private NearDiscovery.Listener getNearDiscoveryListener() {
        return new NearDiscovery.Listener() {
            @Override
            public void onPeersUpdate(Set<Host> hosts) {
                // Handle updates of peer list here - some peer might have got removed if it wasn't reachable anymore or some new peer might have been added
            }

            @Override
            public void onDiscoveryTimeout() {
                // This is called after the discovery timeout (specified in the builder) from starting discovery using the startDiscovery()
            }

            @Override
            public void onDiscoveryFailure(Throwable e) {
                // This is called if discovery could not be started
            }

            @Override
            public void onDiscoverableTimeout() {
                // This is called after the discoverable timeout (specified in the builder) from becoming discoverable by others using the makeDiscoverable()
            }
        };
    }
```
NearDiscovery.Builder.setDiscoverablePingIntervalMillis() tells the interval at which each client broadcasts about its existence. The NearDiscovery.Listener.onPeersUpdate() gets called even if a peer is deemed stale, i.e. it's last broadcast received was more than twice the discoverable-ping-interval ago.

The discovery mechanism takes place in background services which do not hold any wakelocks.
## NearConnect
A NearConnect object provides P2P mechanism with the following self-explanatory APIs:
* ```long send(byte[] bytes, Host peer);```
* ```void startReceiving();```
* ```void stopReceiving(boolean abortCurrentTransfers);```
* ```Set<Host> getPeers();```
* ```boolean isReceiving();```

NearConnect.startReceiving() only tells to start *listening* for any incoming transfers, similarly NearConnect.isReceiving() only tells if the client is listening for transfers or not and *not* if any data is currently being received.
Here's how the NearConnect object is created:
```
        private NearConnect mNearConnect = new NearConnect.Builder()
                .fromDiscovery(mNearDiscovery)
                .setContext(this)
                .setListener(getNearConnectListener(), Looper.getMainLooper())
                .build();
```
The NearDiscovery object passed in NearConnect.Builder.fromDiscovery() is only to get the list of peers from. Peers can be explicitly provided as well:
```
        private NearConnect mNearConnect = new NearConnect.Builder()
                .forPeers(peers) // Set<Host> peers
                .setContext(this)
                .setListener(getNearConnectListener(), Looper.getMainLooper()).build();
```
Again, the NearConnect.Builder.setListener() takes the Listener as the 1st argument and the Looper on which to call the Listener as the 2nd argument. Here's what the Listener looks like:
```
    @NonNull
    private NearConnect.Listener getNearConnectListener() {
        return new NearConnect.Listener() {
            @Override
            public void onReceive(byte[] bytes, final Host sender) {
            // Process incoming data here
            }

            @Override
            public void onSendComplete(long jobId) {
            // jobId is the same as the return value of NearConnect.send(), an approximate epoch time of the send
            }

            @Override
            public void onSendFailure(Throwable e, long jobId) {
            // handle failed sends here
            }

            @Override
            public void onStartListenFailure(Throwable e) {
            // This tells that the NearConnect.startReceiving() didn't go through properly.
            // Common cause would be that another instance of NearConnect is already listening and it's NearConnect.stopReceiving() needs to be called first
            }
        };
    }
```
It's required to stop listening on a previous instance of NearConnect (using NearConnect.stopReceiving()) so as to start listening on another instance (by using NearConnect.startReceiving()).
This is because the same server port is used in each instance (<- could be made configurable later if deemed necessary).

on startReceiving(), and on send() partial wakelocks are held and released on stopReceiving() and on send completion/failure respectively.

***Note:* NearConnect should work even outside of a local network, except across NAT firewalls.**

## Getting Started
Add jitpack.io to your root build.gradle
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```
Then add the dependency in your project build.gradle
```
dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'com.github.adroitandroid:Near:v1.1'
    ...
}
```
You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/adroitandroid/Near/releases/latest/).

## Limitations
- File transfers aren't easy yet. Services are background, API to take notification to start them in foreground, and listener methods to publish updates are on the TODO list.
- Current Min SDK is 21. Pulling it down, after testing, is again on the TODO list.
